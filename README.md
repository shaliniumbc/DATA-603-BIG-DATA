# DATA-603-BIG-DATA

QUESTION 1: BIG DATA WITH EXAMPLE AND TYPES? 

Big Data is a set of information that has large and complex datasets that are extremely large in volume and expanding rapidly over time.  

There are many examples of big data one of them is big data in Education. Predictive analysis can be used by educational institutions to examine previous student performance data and predict possible student results. They can predict probable outcomes or achievements due to this analysis. Analysis of big data can quickly identify the initial symptoms of learning issues or difficulties, providing early detection for struggling students and eventually enhancing academic outcomes. 

Types of BIG DATA are: 

Structured Data: 

Structured data is well organized, stored, and processed in a fixed format known as Structured  

Data. 

Unstructured Data: 

Unstructured data is which does not have a specific format is known as Unstructured Data. It has text, images, audio, and video files. 

Semi-Structured Data: 

Semi-structured data has both Structured and Unstructured Data formats. In this, the data is not as structured as in the structured it has a form structure which is not defined properly. 

 

QUESTION 2: 6 V’S OF BIG DATA? 

The 6 V’s of BIG DATA are: 

Volume 

Velocity 

Variety 

Variability 

Veracity 

Value. 

 

VOLUME: 

The size of the data generated and stored in a Big Data system is defined as volume. Big Data contains the size of data in Petabytes and Exabytes. To process this large amount of data we must use specialized tools and advanced processing technology.  

 

VELOCITY: 

The process where how fast the data can be generated and processed in Big Data is known as Velocity. It determines the data how quickly it is processed to meet the user needs. 

 

VARIETY: 

Variety is defined as different types of forms in data and how they are organized and processed. Big Data has different forms such as Structured, Unstructured and Semi-structured which includes text, images, audio, and video data. 

 

VARIABILITY: 

Variability is defined as the inconsistent nature of the data, which can make data difficult to handle and manage. 

 

VERACITY: 

Veracity is defined as the reliability and quality of the data. The data must be cleaned to extract the necessary information. 

 

VALUE: 

Value is defined as the data that is valuable and reliable. To gain insights, it is also necessary to save and analyze reliable and valuable data. 

 

QUESTION 3: PHASES OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS? 

There are 5 Phases of big Data Analysis 

Data Acquisition and Recording 

Information Extraction and Cleaning 

Data Integration, Aggregation, and Representation 

Query Processing, Data Modeling, and Analysis 

Interpretation 

 

DATA ACQUISITION AND RECORDING: 

Data is collected from Internet of Things sensors, telescopes, social media, and scientific computing, but much of it is irrelevant. To remove unnecessary data while keeping the valuable information, effective filtering and compression are essential, with accurate filters securing data preservation. As shown in pictures with built timestamps and location data, automated metadata production helps in explaining data content and measurement techniques 

 

INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND CLEANING: 

Gathering the necessary data from the sources and arranging it in a structured way that can be easily analyzed and processed is known as Information extraction. 

To replace missing values, reduce noise, and fix data inconsistencies within the dataset and data cleaning is performed. 

DATA INTEGRATION, AGGREGATION, AND REPRESENTATION: 

To reduce duplication and inconsistencies, data integration and aggregation involves combining information from several sources, even if they are different. 

 

Data representation is defined as the different ways that data can be expressed. There are several visual representational tools available such as bar charts, histograms, box plots, an 

 

 

QUERY PROCESSING, DATA MODELING, AND ANALYSIS: 

Queries select particular data subsets from a larger dataset. 

Data models, such as database, entity-relationship, and semantic models, structure and define how data pieces relate. 

Because not all data exists in SQL databases, and some complicated analytical jobs are difficult to complete using SQL queries, Big Data analysis extends beyond SQL queries. 

 

 

INTERPRETATION: 

Evaluating and verifying computer-generated results requires interpretation, which frequently calls for extra information including data sources, methods of reasoning, and input characteristics. This process is helped by visualization, which clarifies the outcomes and makes them suitable for decision-making. 

 

QUESTION 4: CHALLENGES IN BIG DATA ANALYSIS? 

Heterogeneity and Incompleteness 

Scale 

Timeliness 

Privacy 

Human Collaboration 

 

HETEROGENEITY AND INCOMPLETENESS: 

Machine analysis thrives on consistent data but faces challenges with subtle variations. Handling semi-structured data efficiently, even post-cleaning, requires addressing potential incompleteness and errors during probabilistic analysis. 

 

SCALE: 

Since the amount of data is growing exponentially and exceeding the capacity of computers, cloud computing is a possible answer. So that we can store a large amount of data. 

 

TIMELINESS: 

Instant results of analysis are sometimes required, especially when arranging through large datasets to find information that fulfills a set of criteria—an operation like a query or search. 

 

PRIVACY: 

Data privacy is becoming a bigger issue with the development of Big Data because new insights can be obtained from various data factors like location and time. Sharing data while maintaining data privacy is a difficult task that combines social and technological considerations. 

 

HUMAN COLLABORATION: 

Effective Big Data analytics must adopt a "human in the loop" philosophy and combine computer and human analysis. When dealing with issues like debate, uncertainty, and errors in crowd-sourced data from sites like Wikipedia, Yelp reviews, such systems must enable input from different human experts and collaborative result exploration.
